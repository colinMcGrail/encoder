Make encoding work per-word instead of per-character. hopefully that will make it able to encode and decode all file types. I suspect issues with non-text files come down to not being divisible by sizeof(char).
	- per word encoding probably is easier to crack, since ASCII only uses 128 out of 256 possible values, and the alphabet only takes up 52 of those-- need more entropy. Hashing???
	-per bit encoding??? probably too much.

Find out if this actually prevents data recovery.
	
Input sanitization and validity checks

ensure overflows/underflows work as expected without explicit modulo
	-maybe put explicit modulo in anyway, just to be sure
		-make sure modulo arithmetic works as expected with respect to overflows/underflows
			-fuck

Far future:

figure out makefiles to turn this into a single program

GUI???

Put this shit on github
